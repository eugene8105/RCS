RCS - Robotic Communication System

RCS vertion 1.0 is monitoring system first implamantation.
Will monitor ABB RCS5 controller for any errors and if some errors appeared system will send email notifications with error massage.
Set up with two request buttons. When button is pushed it will send slack notification. 
Need to set up hooks for it in RCS_Configuration.xml file.
